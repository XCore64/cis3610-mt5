			Being able to tune your car (step-up) is a feature of Story Mode.<br>

			In Story Mode, you first choose your rival's level, then select an opponent out of the rivals that are of the selected level.<br> 
			
			You can freely change the levels and rivals within the time limit.<br>

			You win if you cross the finish line before your rivals (characters from the original comic book), and you lose if your rivals cross it before you. <br>
